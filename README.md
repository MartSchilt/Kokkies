# Kokkies
One big repository to do everything Godot with The Kokkies.

## Projects
### Multiplayer Test
This is a test scene which was set up to test a peer-to-peer connection between multiple (5 max) clients. Each client controls a PlayerCharacter which is a 3D object with controls to move and jump around the map.

### Western Shooter
Designer: [Sybro](https://github.com/Sybro)

A shooter minigame in which each player has a revolver and can shoot the other players. You get 10 points for killing an opponent and the first person to make it to 100 points wins.

### Slamp Dump!
Designer: [MartSchilt](https://github.com/MartSchilt)

A goofy minigame in which each player needs to take as many dumps on the toilet as possible. The players get points by finishing a dump, they poop faster by pressing certain button prompts and screaming into the microphone. The player race each other in a timed event, and at the end of the time the player with highest score wins.
